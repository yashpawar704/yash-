Project Description
The Scientific Calculator is a robust application designed to handle a wide variety of complex mathematical operations beyond basic arithmetic. It supports functions such as trigonometry, logarithms, exponentiation, and various other advanced calculations commonly used in scientific research, engineering, and academic settings.

Key Features:
Basic Arithmetic Operations: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division.
Trigonometric Functions: sin, cos, tan, and their inverses (arcsin, arccos, arctan).
Logarithmic Functions: Logarithm (base 10), natural logarithm (ln), and exponentiation (e^x).
Power and Root Functions: Exponents, square roots, and nth roots.
Factorial and Permutation/Combination Calculations.
Memory Storage: Store and recall previous calculations.
Technologies Used
